# NetConnectAssignment-ByShree
Developed an interactive Map(Choropleth map) as part of the assignment using the 2014 election data inputs.

# Map Features
The map is colored according to voter turnout in each constituency: 
darker colors indicate a higher voter turnout. I added a tooltip which displays the name of the parliamentary constituency and its percentage of votes by eligible voters when moused over, and there is also a legend for the map.
